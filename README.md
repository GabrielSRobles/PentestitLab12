# Pentestit Lab **12**

This CTF consists in a series of challenges on several security subjects.

The challenge provides us with a  OpenVpn configuration file, and credentials to access the site. 

`sudo openvpn --config lab.pentestit.ru.conf `

After connecting properly to the server we will get access to the network. Here we can reach the challenge machines.  

We are given two directions for starters:

* 192.168.101.12
* 192.168.101.13

For the order in which we resolve the challenges I will make use of the graphs seen in the page, that indicate the ammount of people that has resolved each. We will go from the ones with most resolves to the lowest ones.

We will be starting with the **Mail** challenge.
